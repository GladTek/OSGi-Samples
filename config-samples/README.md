# OSGi modules configuration samples

This project contains examples of how to use configuration with OSGi modules. All the examples use Declarative Services annotations, which is the recommended way of building Jahia Modules. You can find the following examples:

- SimpleConfigExample: a basic as-simple-as-it-gets example of OSGi module configuration
- YamlConfigExample: an example of a module complex structure of configuration
- Metatype: an example of how to add metatype information to your configuration, which makes it a better experience when using OSGi Config Admin UIs such as the Felix Web Console
- Factory: an example of how to build configurations for factories, and in this case we also show how to use factories to build site-specific configurations.
